# Workflow Tool

This project was developed for a Full Stack Engineer interview. I completed it within a day, and it was an enjoyable experience working with Django and React!

## Project Overview

The Workflow Tool is a drag-and-drop flowchart application that allows users to create and manage workflows. The application consists of a React frontend and a Django backend, connected to a MongoDB database. The frontend uses React Flow to manage and render flowchart elements, while the backend handles API requests and authentication.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Flowchart Creation**: Users can easily create and connect flowchart elements using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Backend Integration**: The backend is built with Django and handles API requests, saving workflows, and user authentication.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Secure user authentication is managed through session-based methods.
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB is used to store and manage workflow data.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Flow
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication
